### Hi, I'm Jacob

I'm an undergrad in CS, Math, and Stats at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/) working with [David Duvenaud](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~duvenaud/) at the [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/).

I'm interested in latent variable models, neural ODEs, variational inference, and genomics. My long term research goal is to combine machine learning with novel sources of data to develop new tools for improved diagnosis and treatment of patients.

Some of my hobbies include running, rock climbing, and [reading](https://jacobjinkelly.github.io/bookshelf/). I'm always open to meeting new people, feel free to [get in touch](mailto:jkelly@cs.toronto.edu) if you'd like to chat.
