I'm an undergrad in CS, Math, and Stats at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/). I'm fortunate to work with [David Duvenaud](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~duvenaud/) at the [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/). I'm currently a ML Research Intern at [Deep Genomics](https://www.deepgenomics.com/). I'm interested in energy-based models, latent variable models, neural ODEs, variational inference, and genomics. My research goal is to use machine learning combined with new sources of data to develop tools for diagnosis and treatment of patients.
