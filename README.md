I'm a Research Engineer at [DeepMind](https://www.deepmind.com/). I completed my undergrad in Computer Science, Math, and Stats at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/), where I was fortunate to work with [Roger Grosse](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rgrosse/) and [David Duvenaud](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~duvenaud/) at the [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/). My goal is to use machine learning to understand biology. I'm interested in energy-based models, latent variable models, neural ODEs, and genomics.
